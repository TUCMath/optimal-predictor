# Optimal Prediction using Learning and Shape Optimization

This repository contains code solution for learning-based optimal prediction of distributed parameter systems using sensor shape optimization.

The problem is coded in **Python 3.6.10** and machine learning package **Keras 2.4.0**.

To set the parameters of the problem, use `parameters.py`. 

Run `shape_optimizar.py` to find the solution to the optimal predictor design problem given the parameters. The results will be saved in the directories `.\training-data\`, `.\model\`, and `.\data\`. Directory `.\training-data\` contains the training data generated by this code. Directory `.\model` contains the trained neural-network predictor. Directory `.\data\` contains data including the optimal sensor arrangement `omega_b`, solution `u_real`, prediction `u_pred`, cost values in each iteration of the optimization algorithm `cost_values`.

Run `plotter.py` to plot the results and save them in the path `.\figs\`. Uncomment the subsection: *"to create animation"* in this file in order to generate animations in the directory `.\gifs\`.
